Alpha is the next generation debugging system for iOS applications. It started as an unofficial fork from [FLEX](https://github.com/Flipboard/FLEX) (Flipboard Explorer), but continued to be actively developed and grew exponentionally. Many features were added on top of original FLEX:

- Push Notification logging (independent of provider)
- Console logging (ASL)
- Network logging (based on [PonyDebugger](https://github.com/square/PonyDebugger))
- Bootstrap environment change with [KZBootstrap](https://github.com/krzysztofzablocki/KZBootstrap)
- Screenshot system
- Touches displayed on screen via [Touchpose](https://github.com/toddreed/Touchpose)
- Theme system

Currently work in progress:

**0.2.0**
- *Entire Application State Snapshot*
- *Status information widgets*
- *Remote connection to app (state, debug)*
- *Specify features in podfile using subspecs*

**0.3.0**
- *Recording touches and replaying actions*
- *In-app debugger*


**This is an unofficial fork from the amazing Flipboard guys. It is a big rewrite of FLEX architecture, making it completely extensible, but sadly not backwards compatible with original code.**

*It is currently a work in progress and might be too unstable to be used in real environment yet. Feel free to open GitHub issues.*

## Give Yourself Debugging Superpowers
- Inspect and modify views in the hierarchy.
- See the properties and ivars on any object.
- Dynamically modify many properties and ivars.
- Dynamically call instance and class methods.
- Access any live object via a scan of the heap.
- View the file system within your app's sandbox.
- Explore all classes in your app and linked systems frameworks (public and private).
- Quickly access useful objects such as `[UIApplication sharedApplication]`, the app delegate, the root view controller on the key window, and more.
- Dynamically view and modify `NSUserDefaults` values.

Unlike many other debugging tools, Alpha runs entirely inside your app, so you don't need to be connected to LLDB/Xcode or a different remote debugging server. It works well in the simulator and on physical devices.
